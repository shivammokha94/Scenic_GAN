Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Scenic Mountain Image Generation

Overview

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic scenic mountain images. The model is trained on a dataset of mountain landscapes and learns to produce high-quality synthetic images that resemble real mountain scenes.
